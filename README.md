# EspLight_Discovery

This is a side project based on the EspLight Kickstarter and hardware made by Michiel Brink. This Python script shows all the connected EspLight Nodes on a network using the prescribed discovery methods shown on http://esplight.fridgefire.nl/doku.php?id=wiki:communication_protocol

Special thanks to Michiel Brink for creating EspLight
